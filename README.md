## FlutterDex
FlutterDex is a Pokedex App implemented in Flutter. The goal of this project is to learn and deploy an application using Test Driven Development (TDD) and Clean Architecture ([as proposed by Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)).

### Disclaimer
This is still a work-in-progress and anything is subject to change anytime.
I'm (almost) done with the UI, but I will need to make some changes to the application in order for it to work as my drawings intend.

### Architecture Proposal

### UI Prototypes
Disclaimer: I don't know what I'm doing. This was the first time using Adobe XD to do anything.
This is what I've come up with so far:
