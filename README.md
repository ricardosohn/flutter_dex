## FlutterDex
FlutterDex is a Pokedex App implemented in Flutter. The goal of this project is to learn and deploy an application using Test Driven Development (TDD) and Clean Architecture ([as proposed by Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)).

### Disclaimer
This is still a work-in-progress and anything is subject to change anytime.
I'm still planning the UI, but after that some more features are going to be implemented.

### Architecture Proposal
